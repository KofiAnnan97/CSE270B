CSE 270B, Schedule
==========

Reminder: According to the state of Ohio, 1 credit hour = 2250 minutes of work (combining both in-class time and out-of-class time). Therefore, the expectation is that you will work 37.5 hours per week in this class.

Weeklet 5 (Jan 20/21)
----

> Play: Your choice
> ---
> For Monday morning: Select one game from the library. Each student should select a different 
> game, and this will be the basis for your final essay.

> Reading/writing:
> ---
> Due on Tuesday, at 11:59pm, by email to the professor: Write a critical
> analysis of your selected game. How did the VCS platform
> influence the design of the game? How did the author subvert the
> intentions of the hardware designers in making the game? How has
> the game influenced later games, and how was it influenced by previous
> games (particularly arcade games). Was the game primarily a port of
> an arcade game, or was it a new form of game that only makes sense in the
> context of the living room? Was it a "good" game at the time it was
> released? Would we judge it differently today? Why?
>
> Monday morning: Be prepared to discuss your progress on your paper.
> In particular, what are useful approaches for writing the paper so that
> it is interesting, and worth reading?

> Designing:
> ---
> Tuesday morning: Mid-point presentation and critique for final project games.

Weeklet 6 (Jan 23/24)
----

> Play: Playtesting games for other groups
> ---

> and giving them feedback to help improve their games. Most useful info is:
> Features that can be cut/simplified!

> Reading/writing:
> ---
> Friday (SPECIAL TIME): Prepare a manual for your game, with at least one
> high quality hard copy to be handed in to the professor. You may want
> several copies so that your classmates can skim them during your
> presentation.

> Designing:
> ---
> Friday (SPECIAL TIME): Final presentations and critique. We will be 
> videotaping this session, eventually posting a video diary of the class
> on YouTube.
